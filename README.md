# Notes

    Start project from scratch (this was a personal decision because I am not in favor of using boilerplates since you loose control over the application), starting with an npm init, and progressively adding dependencies.

    Use git hooks (pre commit) in order to check code quality (for now run only linter, ideally should run test also).
